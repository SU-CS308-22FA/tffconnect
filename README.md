How to Build the APP
-------

The source code can be downloaded directly from GitHub. The project is built upon two main directories,
tffconnect_backend and tffconnect_frontend. These modules can be access from the same repository but 
have to be run separately on the local computer. The backend consists of another project folder containing
all endpoints of the project. On the other hand, the frontend consists of src and app inside the src.
The components used in the project, authorization related information, hooks and views are all separated
in a clear manner within frontend related folders.
